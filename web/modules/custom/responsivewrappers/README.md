INTRODUCTION
------------

Responsive wrappers module adds a new filter in your input formats that checks
the content and adds the video wrapper for responsive videos with 16/9 or 4/3
ratio aspect, the table wrapper and image class to control responsive
breakpoints and content size.

This is useful because users can use the WYSIWYG to add videos, tables or
images and magically append the responsive wrappers, without the need to allow
users to create divs or know or remember to add the bootstrap responsive
wrappers or classes.

This module can also work without Bootstrap with a custom CSS that can be added
in module settings or with custom classes.
